# Variational-Autoencoder
This project is on variational autoencoders which can be considered as the first step towards deep learning. The model was trained on a subset of the famous CelebA dataset and I studied all the ideas from the excellent book on Generative Deep Learning by David Foster.

Data was downloaded from Kaggle.
